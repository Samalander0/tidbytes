# Tidbytes

Tidbytes is a collection of random highly-designed components. Each component aims to add a bit of fun and magic to your site, and they're incredibly easy to copy and paste.

## Next steps
Soon, there will be more components, and dark mode!

## Development
Tidbytes was created using SvelteKit. CSS was written in SCSS, but nesting and other features used in the code snipets are now available in vanilla CSS.
